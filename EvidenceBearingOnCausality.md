# Introduction #
Here is a short review of evidence bearing on causality as described in _Stratton KR, Howe CJ, Johnston RB Jr, eds. Adverse events associated with childhood vaccines: evidence bearing on causality. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1994:464._ (see http://bit.ly/qWiWkW)


# Details #
Four types of evidence are considered:
  * Biological plausibility
Information on the biological plausibility of causal relation is furthermore classified as theoretical or demonstrated.
  * Case reports, case series and uncontrolled observational studies
  * Controlled observational studies
  * Controlled clinical trials

The last 3 types of evidence are classified as nonexistent, indeterminate, or weighing for or against a determination of causal relation.

The consideration of the four types of evidence allows to reach a conclusion regarding evidence bearing on causality.
There are 5 categories of conclusions:
  * Category 1: no evidence bearing on a causal relation
  * Category 2: the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation
  * Category 3: the evidence favors rejection of a causal relation
  * Category 4: the evidence favors acceptance of a causal relation
  * Category 5: the evidence establishes a causal relation
