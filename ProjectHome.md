In vaccine safety, reports of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) may initiate further investigation of potential problems and facilitate subsequent dissemination of safety-related information to the scientific community and the public. However, current reporting methods used in the electronic data capture system are not sufficient, mitigating their usefulness.

Regarding vaccine adverse events, the Brighton Collaboration has done extensive work towards standardization of AEFIs. Availability of these case definitions in a computer amenable format in addition to the existing human readable one would increase accuracy and quality or reporting, and enable further automated analysis on clinical data, potentially allowing detection of adverse events in a large population.

**The Adverse Event Reporting Ontology (AERO) is an ontology aimed at improving the accessibility to humans, and enable automated reasoning on large datasets to improve adverse event detection.**

The latest AERO file is always available at  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/aero.owl. This file is an early draft, expect it to change. Official releases will be marked as such, and will comply with ID and deprecation policies.
