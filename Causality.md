# Introduction #

Establishment of a causal relationship between the medical intervention and the adverse event.


# Details #


In `[1]`, the Institute of Medecine details the causality evidence found between reported adverse events and vaccines, and classified them into categories of plausible causality in between as follow:
  1. No evidence bearing on a causal relation
  1. The evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation
  1. The evidence favors rejection of a causal relation
  1. The evidence favors acceptance of a causal relation
  1. The evidence establishes a causal relation
depending on the supporting evidence (biological plausibility, case reports, case series and uncontrolled observational studies)

An interesting discussion on causality and evidence can be found in the book `[2]`, in which the committee concludes that most of the adverse events have multifactorial etiologies. In `[3]` Kramer and Lane discuss what is causality, what are necessary and sufficient causes, and how to appreciate the retrodictive ("_Did it?_" - in one individual exhibiting the adverse event, was it caused by the medical intervention?), potential ("_Can it?_" - can the medical intervention cause the adverse event?) and predictive ("_Will it?_" - will the next person after the same intervention have the same adverse event?) causal propositions.
